# UK Malifaux Community Website

There will be more information coming here!

This is a project for the UK Malifaux community to:

- celebrate the painting, players, TOs and events that happen
- provide resources for TOs and players
- give some tools to TOs to generate web pages for their events, and hopefully remove some of their admin burden.

It will be open source, when I've got my head round license and collaboration is welcome - information on how will come when the project is established enough to write it out ðŸ¤·
